# Aboutness endpoint (/text)

You can use the `/text` API endpoint to tag your own free text with OpenAlex's "aboutness" assignmentsâ€”topics, keywords, and concepts.

Accepts a `title` and optional `abstract` in the GET params or as a POST request. The results are straight from the model, with 0 values truncated.

#### Examples

* Get OpenAlex [Keywords](./keywords/README.md) for your text\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/text/keywords?title=type%201%20diabetes%20research%20for%20children`](https://api.openalex.org/text/keywords?title=type%201%20diabetes%20research%20for%20children)
* Get OpenAlex [Topics](./topics/README.md) for your text\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/text/topics?title=type%201%20diabetes%20research%20for%20children`](https://api.openalex.org/text/topics?title=type%201%20diabetes%20research%20for%20children)
* Get OpenAlex [Concepts](./concepts/README.md) for your text\
  [`https://api.openalex.org/text/concepts?title=type%201%20diabetes%20research%20for%20children`](https://api.openalex.org/text/concepts?title=type%201%20diabetes%20research%20for%20children)
* Get all of the above in one request\
